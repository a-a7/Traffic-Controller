#Traffic-Controller

##Background
This project is to make a traffic controller on an FPGA using VHDL. The traffic controller will have buttons which pedestrians can press to change the lights to allow them to cross the street. A general idea of the physical system can be seen in Figure 1. The lights will be determined by the state of the machine. Meaning for this project a finite state machine can be made.
